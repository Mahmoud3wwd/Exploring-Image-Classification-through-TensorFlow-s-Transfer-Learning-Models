# Exploring Image Classification through TensorFlowâ€™s InceptionV3 Transfer Learning in Google Colab
# Image Classification with Transfer Learning

This repository demonstrates image classification using transfer learning with popular convolutional neural network architectures: VGG16, InceptionV3, and MobileNet. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models to classify images efficiently with fewer data and computational resources.

## Overview

This project includes implementations of image classification using the following models:
- **VGG16**: A deep convolutional neural network architecture that is known for its simplicity and effectiveness.
- **InceptionV3**: A model designed to optimize computational efficiency with a novel inception module.
- **MobileNet**: A lightweight model optimized for mobile and edge devices, offering a good balance between speed and accuracy.
